This exercise is described in the flexdashboard itself. Go ahead and open `exercise.Rmd` file and press `Run document` at the top of the document. You should see a pop-up window with the flex dashboard open like below.

```{r instructions}
knitr::include_graphics("graphics/intstructions.png")
```

Go ahead and explore the dashboard. Check out the description of the penguins dataset. 

```{r penguins_desc}
knitr::include_graphics("graphics/penguins_desc.png")
```

Check out the Visuals tab. 

```{r visauls}
knitr::include_graphics("graphics/visuals.png")
```

And the Data tab.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("graphics/data.png")
```

Now, come back to exercise instructions and proceed with editing the exercise file. When in doubt ask or look up an example answer in `example_answered.Rmd` file. Good luck!
